# It√©lios Challenge 2
The second Front End challenge of the Itelios 

## 1 - About the tools:
I would like to use the Gulp to automate some tasks, such as:

- Minify the HTML;
- Concatenate and minify the CSS;
- Pre-process via SASS;
- Let the files ready for deploy. 

But, because it is a small component, I decided to make the project as simple as possible.
